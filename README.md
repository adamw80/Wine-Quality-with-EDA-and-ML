# Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting wine quality based on various chemical properties using machine learning models. By analyzing attributes such as alcohol content, pH, sulfur dioxide levels, and acidity, the project aims to classify wines into different quality categories and uncover key factors that influence the final rating.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol
- quality (target variable)

## Key Objectives
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between wine attributes and quality.
2. Train machine learning models to predict wine quality.
3. Identify the most important features influencing wine quality.
